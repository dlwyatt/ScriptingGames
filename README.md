Entries for the 2014 Winter Scripting Games, team "Troll Bait"

Team members were Dave Wyatt and Mike Laughlin.

Note:  Some of the files in the repository were work-in-progress files that were not part of the final submissions.  These files tend to contain older versions with partially duplicate code, which were eventually merged into files like Event#.psm1.
