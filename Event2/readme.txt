PSLogging.zip is a module that needs to be extracted to the same folder
as UploadSecurityFootprint.ps1, if you want to run it with the -LogFile parameter.

UploadSecurityFootprint.log is the log file that was generated during one
of the script executions in Transcript.txt; included on the Games site as an
example of the output produced by the PSLogging module.
