The support for long paths in this entry comes from a modified version of the
Microsoft.Experimental.IO assembly from http://bcl.codeplex.com/releases/view/42783 .
This assembly originally provided basic functionality for files and folders, but did
not include anything related to security descriptors.

Our changes to this assembly are listed in the three .CS files that have been uploaded
with the entry, though only the DLL is required to actually run the scripts.

The two PS1 files are the "entry points" for this submission.  CreateFinanceDepartmentFolders-2014_02_07.ps1 creates the folder structure, assigns permissions, and saves a CSV file detailing what it did.

AnalyzePermissions-2014_02_07.ps1 reads that CSV file and compares it to permissions on disk.  It can either generate an HTML report of the permissions, or actually fix them (depending on whether you use the -FixPermissions switch.)

CreateFinance-2014_07_07.csv is the CSV file that was generated during the execution that was captured in our transcript.

Finance-2014_02_07.html is the HTML report generated by the AnalyzePermisisons script during the transcript.
